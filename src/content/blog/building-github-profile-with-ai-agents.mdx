## Why Your GitHub Profile Matters More Than You Think

Your GitHub profile is the first thing a recruiter, collaborator, or open-source maintainer sees when they search for you. It's a product page, a resume, and a personality test — all at once. Yet most developers treat it as an afterthought.

I didn't want that. So I built mine the way I build everything now: **with an AI agent team**.

## The Setup: Four Agents, One Goal

Instead of prompting a single AI to "write my README", I assembled a four-agent team inside GitHub Copilot, each with a distinct role:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `profile-designer` | Visual architecture — layout, components, color system |
| `content-writer` | Turns design plans into working Markdown code |
| `researcher` | Investigates external tools, themes, and options |
| `qa-reviewer` | Multi-dimensional quality audit after each iteration |

The key insight: **specialization beats generalism** even for AI. A vague prompt to one agent produces mediocre output. A targeted brief to a specialized agent — with constraints, context, and clear output format — produces work you can actually ship.

## The Workflow in Practice

### Step 1 — Team Meeting

Before writing a single line of Markdown, I ran a "parallel full-team meeting". All four agents reviewed the current state of the profile against a rubric:

```
designer:  Visual score 6.5/10 — "component showroom, no narrative rhythm"
qa:        Engineering score 4/10 — "CI completely missing"
writer:    Content score 6/10 — "JSON self-intro is thin"
```

This produced a concrete V2.0 plan with 30+ actionable tasks, prioritized and phased.

### Step 2 — Phased Execution

Tasks were grouped into phases (A/B/C/D/E), each executable by a single agent without human intervention between steps:

- **Phase A** — Restructure README block order, expand JSON, add Connect section
- **Phase B** — `<picture>` dual-mode (dark/light) for every visual component
- **Phase C** — Astro site: navigation, footer, Blog with Content Collections
- **Phase D** — CI (link-check + markdown-lint), `.editorconfig`, v1.0.0 tag

### Step 3 — QA Before Push

Every set of changes passes through `qa-reviewer` before commit. No exceptions. This catches broken URLs, missing alt text, and theme inconsistencies before they reach production.

## What "AI-Native" Actually Means

It doesn't mean "prompt an AI and accept whatever comes out."

It means **structuring your work so AI agents can operate autonomously on well-defined tasks**, while humans handle ambiguity (what to build) and validation (does this look right).

The result: I shipped more changes in one session than I'd normally do in a week — and the output quality was higher because every decision was traced and every component was reviewed.

## The Template is Open Source

The entire setup — agent definitions, instructions, design decisions log, workflow docs — is available at [njueeRay/OpenProfile](https://github.com/njueeRay/OpenProfile). Fork it, adapt the agents to your identity, and ship your own V2.0.
